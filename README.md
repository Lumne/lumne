# Hello, I'm Jonathan Logan Clark

 * 💻 I have been doing front end development for over 10 years.
 * 👨‍🎨 I have been doing design for over 15 years and have a bachelor's 👨‍🎓 degree in Communication Design. This discipline has empowered me to solve problems in the following specializations of design.
   * 📱 Responsive Web & UI design
   * 👨‍💻 Graphic design 
   * 👾 Game design
 * 📊 I have been practicing marketing and analytics for over 12 years.
 * ♿️ I am passionate about accessibility and it drives many of the design & development decisions that I make.
 * 📚 I studied and grew into a front end developer, digital marketing, and analytics due to the need that was apparent to me across multiple organizations I worked for. I 💙 bridging the gap between design, development, and marketing. 
   * It started when I noticed that most developers I worked with were too busy or unable to implement my designs well. I had also noticed that a couple other designer friends of mine had begun to learn basic HTML, CSS, and JS to ensure parity... It just made sense for me to do the same.
   * It grew as responsive design took over adaptive design and I saw opportunity to make web solutions work for all devices.
   * I delved deeper into JS and analyitcs when teammate wanted out of managing and developing for analytics solutions. There were problems to solve and insights to provide for my team.
   * I unravelled a great deal of mystery for my clients and teams when there was need to understand the complexities of search engine optimization and web application performance.
   * And the story continues...
